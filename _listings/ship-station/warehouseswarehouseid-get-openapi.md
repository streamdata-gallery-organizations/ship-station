        This endpoint can be used to create or update multiple orders in one request. If the ``orderKey`` is specified in an order, the existing order with that key will be updated. Note: Only orders in an open status in ShipStation (``awaiting_payment``,``awaiting_shipment``, and ``on_hold``) can be updated through this method. ``cancelled`` and ``shipped`` are locked from modification through the API.

        Obtains a list of shipments that match the specified criteria.  Please note the following:

        - Only valid shipments with labels generated in ShipStation will be returned in the response. Orders that have been marked as shipped either through the UI or the API will not appear as they are considered external shipments.

        - To include every shipment's associated shipmentItems in the response, be sure to set the `includeShipmentItems` parameter to `true`.

        All of the available filters are optional.  They do not need to be included in the URL.  If you do include them, here's what the URL may look like:
